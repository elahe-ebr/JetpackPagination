What is this repository for?

When working with RecyclerViews in our Android project, we display a list with many items in it. Loading large amounts of data simultaneously into a task list is not very efficient. To overcome this problem, we have paging in Android.

Using the Paging library, we can load a lot of data efficiently and only load the data when we need it. In this repository, I explained about the Paging 3 library in Android and how to use it to efficiently load a large collection of data into my RecyclerView.
